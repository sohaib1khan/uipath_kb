The successful RPA Developer combines a good grasp of the technical skills with the ability to quickly understand business processes regarding inputs, outputs, and decision points. The latter will come into play when collaborating with an RPA Business Analyst on a large implementation project or when undertaking a smaller project on your own.

    **Definition:** A process is a set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs.
    
- bullet
    
    **Components of a process:**
    
    - **Inputs** - the data that goes in the process.
    - **Process Flows** - the sequences of sub-processes or activities undertaken in the process.
    - **Source Applications** - the applications or systems used to perform the sub-processes or activities of the process.
    - **Outputs** - the result generated by the process.
- bullet
    
    **Things to remember:** The outputs of a process can serve as inputs for other processes.
    

Organizations use processes because planning and executing them under controlled conditions can, among other things, improve compliance, ensure that operational needs are met, help in managing risks, and drive improvement.

****The relation between processes and procedures****

There are a lot of things that are missing from the definition of a standard process, such as time constraints, dependency on other processes, variations and how resources are assigned. This is where procedures come into play. Essentially, a procedure complements a process and describes the way it's carried out; it explains who's responsible for each part of the process, when each part of the process needs to occur, how to handle exceptions, and the specifications applicable to each part of the process.

**A procedure explains:**

- Who's responsible for each part of the process.
- When each part of the process needs to occur.
- How to handle exceptions.
- The specifications applicable to each part of the process.

In what concerns the way they are documented, processes and procedures are different. A process is typically documented via a diagram, be it a flowchart or workflow, which aims to highlight the logical sequence of the process steps. A procedure, on the other hand, is often a complex, written document, focused on providing guidelines.

**Process example: Order-to-Cash**

To better understand this, let's take a commonly used automated business process and compare the manual ("As Is") flowchart with the automated ("To Be") flowchart.

1.  A Purchase Order (PO) is received via email.
2.  The agent opens the email attachment and checks that the product code is present in the PO.
3.  If the product code is present in the PO, the agent opens SAP and runs a specific SAP transaction.
    1.  If the product code is not present in the PO, the agent looks it up in the master data file.
    2.  If the product code is present in the master data file, the agent opens SAP and runs a specific SAP transaction.
    3.  If the product code is not present in the master data file, the agent sends out an email to the Master Data Analyst to update the file.
4.  Once the product code is provided, the agent populates the required fields in the SAP screen, as per the organization requirements and the PO .
5.  Next, the agent generates the sales order.
6.  Finally, the agent replies to the initial email, adds the Sales Order in the attachment and moves the email to the processed folder.

**The "As-Is" process diagram**

    **Inputs** - The received Email message.
    
- bullet
    
    **Process Flows** - the verification of the product code presence, the SAP transaction execution and the SAP fields population.
    
- bullet
    
    **Source Applications** - Outlook, Desktop and SAP.
    
- bullet
    
    **Outputs** - the result generated by the process.
    

Also, there are several sub-process outputs that serve as input for other sub-processes. For example, the result of the missing product code in the master data file check represents an input for the master data analyst to update the file.

In the context of an RPA implementation, the process flow we have just described, along with the procedure documenting it, would be considered the “As-Is” process.

The "To-Be" process diagram

The “To-Be” process for our example factors in the potential of RPA. As we can see, most of the manual steps of the process (previously colored in blue) can be automated through RPA.
