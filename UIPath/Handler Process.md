### Input Handler:

An input handler is a component or module within an automation system that is responsible for receiving and processing input data or user inputs. In the context of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) or automation workflows, an input handler may capture data from various sources such as user interfaces, files, databases, or APIs. It validates, transforms, and prepares the input data for further processing by downstream components or modules.

### Process Handler:

A process handler is a component or module within an automation system that manages the execution of business processes or automation workflows. It coordinates the flow of activities, controls the sequence of operations, and orchestrates interactions between different components or systems. The process handler may include logic for error handling, exception management, and workflow optimization to ensure efficient and reliable execution of processes.

### Input & Process Handler:

An input and process handler is a combined component or module that integrates both input handling and process handling capabilities within an automation system. It combines the functionality of receiving and processing input data with managing the execution of automation workflows or business processes. This integration streamlines the automation development process and enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of automation solutions.

### Input, Process, & Output Handler:

An input, process, and output handler is a comprehensive component or module within an automation system that encompasses input handling, process handling, and output handling capabilities. In addition to receiving and processing input data and managing process execution, it also handles the generation and delivery of output or results to downstream systems or stakeholders. This may include generating reports, sending notifications, updating databases, or triggering follow-up actions based on the outcomes of the automation processes.

### Sending Reports to Business for Viewing:

In the context of automation workflows, sending reports to the business for viewing typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** The input handler gathers relevant data from various sources, such as databases, applications, or files.
    
2.  **Data Processing:** The process handler executes predefined tasks or workflows to analyze, manipulate, or transform the input data as required.
    
3.  **Report Generation:** The output handler generates reports based on the processed data, using templates or formats specified by the business requirements. This may involve aggregating data, applying formatting, and adding visualizations or charts.
    
4.  **Delivery:** The output handler delivers the generated reports to the intended recipients or stakeholders within the business. This could be done through email, web portals, dashboards, or other communication channels.
    
5.  **Viewing:** Business users can access and view the reports using the designated viewing platform or application. They can analyze the data, gain insights, and make informed decisions based on the information provided in the reports.
