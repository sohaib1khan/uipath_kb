### 1\. Data Loading (Get-Next/Bulk-Load):

**Purpose:** Monitoring data loading processes ensures that data is successfully retrieved from its source and loaded into the target system for further processing.

- **Get-Next:** This refers to the process of retrieving data records one at a time from a data source, typically in a sequential manner. Monitoring Get-Next involves tracking the progress of data retrieval, identifying any delays or errors, and ensuring that all expected records are fetched successfully.
    
- **Bulk-Load:** Bulk loading involves retrieving and loading data in large batches or chunks, rather than individual records. Monitoring bulk-load processes involves tracking the volume of data being loaded, monitoring performance metrics such as throughput and latency, and detecting any issues or bottlenecks in the loading process.
    

**Monitoring Metrics:**

- **Data Volume:** Monitor the volume of data loaded per unit of time to ensure it meets expected throughput requirements.
- **Latency:** Measure the time taken to retrieve and load data to identify any delays or performance issues.
- **Error Rate:** Track the number of errors or failures encountered during data loading to assess data quality and reliability.

### 2\. Processing Whether It's Processing as Expected (Completing, Exception/Outsort):

**Purpose:** Monitoring processing ensures that data is processed accurately and efficiently according to predefined business rules and requirements.

- **Completing:** Monitoring the completion of processing tasks involves tracking the progress of automation workflows or business processes from start to finish. This includes verifying that all required steps and activities are executed successfully and that the process reaches its intended conclusion without errors or interruptions.
    
- **Exception/Outsort:** Exceptions or outliers may occur during data processing when unexpected conditions or errors are encountered. Monitoring exceptions involves identifying and handling these exceptional cases appropriately, such as logging errors, notifying stakeholders, or routing data for manual review or intervention. Outsort refers to handling data that does not meet predefined criteria or conditions and may require special treatment or processing.
    

**Monitoring Metrics:**

- **Success Rate:** Measure the percentage of processing tasks completed successfully without errors or exceptions.
- **Exception Rate:** Track the frequency and types of exceptions encountered during processing to identify trends and root causes.
- **Processing Time:** Monitor the time taken to process data from input to output to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the processing workflow.

### 3\. How Many Servers Are Up/Active:

**Purpose:** Monitoring server availability and activity ensures the reliability, performance, and uptime of server infrastructure supporting data processing and automation workflows.

**Monitoring Metrics:**

- **Server Uptime:** Track the percentage of time that servers are operational and available for processing tasks.
- **Server Health:** Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network bandwidth to assess server health and performance.
- **Active Connections:** Monitor the number of active connections or sessions to servers to ensure they are adequately handling workload demands.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up alerts and notifications to notify administrators of any issues or abnormalities in server availability or performance, allowing them to take timely action to resolve issues and minimize downtime.

### Processing Status Flag (0-3) - Bot-Specific with Common Meanings

The processing status flag is a variable or indicator used within automation workflows or bots to track the status or progress of processing tasks. It provides insight into the current state of a particular task or operation, allowing stakeholders to monitor and manage workflow execution effectively.

**Common Status Values:**

1.  **0 - Null / Pending:**
    
    - Indicates that the processing task has not yet started or is pending execution. This status typically signifies that the task is queued for processing but has not been initiated.
2.  **1 - In-progress / Working:**
    
    - Indicates that the processing task is currently in progress or being executed by the bot. This status suggests that the task is actively being worked on and is not yet complete.
3.  **2 - Completed:**
    
    - Indicates that the processing task has been successfully completed or executed without errors. This status signifies that the task has reached its intended conclusion and has been successfully processed.
4.  **3 - Outsort / Exception:**
    
    - Indicates that the processing task encountered an exception or error condition during execution. This status suggests that the task could not be completed as expected and requires further attention or intervention. Outsort refers to handling data that does not meet predefined criteria or conditions and may require special treatment or processing.
